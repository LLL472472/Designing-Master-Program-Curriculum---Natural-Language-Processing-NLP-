# Designing-Master-Program-Curriculum---Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-

Developed a Python script employing advanced web scraping techniques to extract details from job postings on Indeed. These details encompassed job
titles, company information, locations, ratings, salary data, and thorough job descriptions, providing a comprehensive source of insights.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to discern critical job market skills, performed TF-IDF preprocessing, and harnessed K-means clustering,
augmented by the elbow method, to pinpoint optimal cluster count, thereby informing the design of courses for a novel master program.
